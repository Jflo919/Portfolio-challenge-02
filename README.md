# Julian Floyd: My Professional Portfolio
## Weekly Challenge 02

### Description:
This webpage will be my professional portfolio. It contains a nav bar with functioning links to about me, my work, and contact me sections. 

Some of the images are placeholders, because the portfolio item has not been completed yet.

Media Queries have been added to change the following features:

* flex-direction for nav links changes from row to column on smaller screens.
* my work images/links go from from two- sectioned columns to one centered column.
* font-sizes have been increased for smaller screen-sizes, especially for screens up to 575 px
* up to 575px screen width, contact me section changes flex-direction to column.
